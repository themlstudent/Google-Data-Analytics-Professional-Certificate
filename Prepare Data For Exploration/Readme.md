## Week 1:

##### How Data is Collected:

- Interviews
- Observations
- Forms
- Questionnaires
- Surveys
- Cookies

 #### Selecting the Right Data: 
 
1. **How the data will be collected:**

Decide if you will collect the data using your own resources or receive (and possibly purchase it) from another party. Data that you collect yourself is called first-party data.

2. **Data sources:**

If you don’t collect the data using your own resources, you might get data from second-party or third-party data providers. Second-party data is collected directly by another group and then sold. Third-party data is sold by a provider that didn’t collect the data themselves. Third-party data might come from a number of different sources.

3. **Solving your business problem:**

Datasets can show a lot of interesting information. But be sure to choose data that can actually help solve your problem question. For example, if you are analyzing trends over time, make sure you use time series data — in other words, data that includes dates.

4. **How much data to collect**

If you are collecting your own data, make reasonable decisions about sample size. A random sample from existing data might be fine for some projects. Other projects might need more strategic data collection to focus on certain criteria. Each project has its own needs. 

Time frame
If you are collecting your own data, decide how long you will need to collect it, especially if you are tracking trends over a long period of time. If you need an immediate answer, you might not have time to collect new data. In this case, you would need to use historical data that already exists.
